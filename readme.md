To run this project, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Make sure you have Python installed.
   - Create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

2. **Set Environment Variables**:
   - Configure the necessary environment variables for Flask and JWT.

3. **Run the Application**:
   - Initialize the database and start the Flask development server.

Here are the detailed steps:

### Step 1: Set up the Project Directory and Files

Create the following directory structure:

```
/twitter-clone-api
    |-- app.py
    |-- models.py
    |-- extensions.py
    |-- config.py
    |-- requirements.txt
```

Create and add content to each file as described previously.

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and create a virtual environment:

```sh
cd /path/
python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- On macOS/Linux:
  ```sh
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

- On Windows:
  ```sh
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

Install the dependencies using `pip`:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Set Environment Variables

Set the necessary environment variables. You can do this by creating a `.env` file in your project directory and adding the following lines:

```sh
export FLASK_APP=app.py
export FLASK_ENV=development
export SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
export JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret_key
```

To load these environment variables, you can source the `.env` file:

```sh
source .env
```

Alternatively, you can set the environment variables directly in your terminal session.

### Step 4: Run the Application

Run the Flask application to create the database and start the server:

```sh
flask run
```

The server should now be running, and you can access it at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

### Testing the API Endpoints

You can use tools like `curl`, Postman, or any other HTTP client to test the API endpoints.

1. **Register a new user**:

```sh
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/register -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username":"testuser", "email":"test@example.com", "password":"password"}'
```

2. **Login**:

```sh
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/login -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email":"test@example.com", "password":"password"}'
```

3. **Post a Tweet** (replace `YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN` with the token you received from the login response):

```sh
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/tweets -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" -d '{"content":"This is a test tweet"}'
```

4. **Get all Tweets**:

```sh
curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/tweets -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

These steps should help you set up and run the Flask project successfully. If you encounter any issues, check the console for error messages and ensure all environment variables are set correctly.
